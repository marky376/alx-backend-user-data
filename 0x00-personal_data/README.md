## Introduction

This project focuses on the management and protection of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and other sensitive personal data. With increasing regulations around data privacy and the critical need to secure user information, this project aims to provide a robust solution for handling PII in compliance with various data protection laws.

## Features

- **Data Encryption**: Encrypts sensitive data to ensure it remains secure and unreadable to unauthorized parties.
- **Data Masking**: Masks PII to protect identities in non-production environments.
- **Access Control**: Implements strict access control mechanisms to limit who can view or modify sensitive information.
- **Data Auditing**: Tracks access and modifications to data, providing an audit trail for compliance and security monitoring.
- **Compliance**: Ensures adherence to data privacy regulations such as GDPR, CCPA, and more.

## Technologies

This project leverages a variety of technologies to deliver its features:

- **Flask**: A lightweight WSGI web application framework in Python.
- **Flask-Babel**: Adds support for internationalization and localization to Flask applications.
- **SQLAlchemy**: A powerful SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for Python.
- **Jinja2**: A modern templating language for Python, used for rendering HTML.
- **Python**: The programming language used for the development of this project.
- **HTML/CSS**: For creating the user interface of the web application.
